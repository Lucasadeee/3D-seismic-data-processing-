Technological advances in oil and gas reservoir characterization such as 3D seismics attributes enriched the subsurfaceâ€™s description made by specialists. Nevertheless, the analysis of this now huge volume of data became a complex task. This work explores the use of convolutional neural networks for seismic facies classification, one of the steps of reservoir characterization. Through a sampling method that captures spacial informationof seismic data, the models produced were applied in both synthetic data of the Stanford VI-E reservoir and in a benchmark based on the F3 block, which is part of a real reservoir. Compared to other models in the same benchmark, the classifiers produced here had similar results, with over 90% class accuracy on some instances. The sampling method is also flexible to use in practical cases.

## Setup
After you've created your python virtual environment, run:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## install setup file
run python setup.py install from cmd

### Stanford VI-E
The raw Stanford VI-E dataset used in this repo is included. To generate the training examples, use the following script (see --help for arguments).
```
python src/data/make_dataset.py
```

### F3-Block
The F3 data used in this repo is avaiable [here](https://github.com/olivesgatech/facies_classification_benchmark). 
numpy arrays for seismic data and their labels can be downloaded from the link above.
To generate the training examples, use the following script (see --help for arguments).

```
python src/data/make_dataset_f3.py
```

## Running
Jupyter notebooks are located in ```/notebooks```. The trained models are stored in ```/models```.
